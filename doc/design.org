* IDEA Remote vs Local Issue Tracking
	If a local file is stored representing a remote issue tracking system...

** Working online?
	 Let's start off by assuming that while a developer is working they always have
	 access to the remote tracking system, and that this system is fast and
	 reliable.

*** What happens when an issue is changed remotely?
		How will the local system become aware of changes?  When?
**** Periodically poll?																									 :no:
		 - Disrupts workflow - wanderlust becomes unresponsive when fetching mail
			 which is very frustrating.  We shouldn't do this if there is any
			 alternative.
		 - Only partially adresses the problem.  Things still diverge between polls.
**** Poll when the developer interacts with issue system?
		 - Less disruptive - only comes up when interacting with issue tracking
		 - Allows systems to diverge significantly - developer may be surprised by
			 extensive changes.
			 - This doesn't seem to be a new problem.
		 - May be slow if the remote system is slow or the dataset is large.
			 - Is this worse than working with the remote system directly?

** Working offline?
	 What happens if the developer is working offline?

*** What happens when the developer has changes to make to issues?
**** Disallow editing?
		 - This may be confusing.
		 - Pretty much eliminates usefulness of storing issues locally.
		 - Reasonably easy to implement.
**** Accumulate and apply later?
		 - Difficult semantics
			 - What if both have changed?
		 - Would be really cool/useful for working offline.
		 - Maybe a partial system could work?
			 - Only allow creation of new issues?
			 - Maybe we can accumulate and squash comments?
			 - Use an org property to mark things as local-only
			 - Opens the door to hybrid systems - some local-only + some remote

*** What happens when the remote system changes?
**** Is this a problem?
